# Planner

## **Description**

This planner has been designed to allow the user to enter and save events for a particular time of their day. The date and time will automatically populate at the top of the page.  The time blocks are color coordinated to indicate whether the given time/event is in the past, present, or future. Once the events have been recorded & saved, they will remain on the schedule even when the page is refreshed.
